## Concept
[What does commute do to you?](http://time.com/9912/10-things-your-commute-does-to-your-body/)
Go ahead and read that article. Don't worry, I'll wait for you.
This app aims to solve your commuting problems and boredom by creating *all-in-one dashboard.*
My aim is to make an hour long commute feel like 10 minute ride.

#### What does commuters do when they commute?
- Some read books *(boring)*
- Play games
- Spend time on their social media
- Some read news during their commute

So this app aims to combine the last 3 of the commuter's activity into one place, one dashboard to rule them all!.
